# IBM manuscript audit and focused campaign

Opened after the final pseudoprocess freeze commit `a69daf025f2c9ef28e39124f2f4a5a301494666f`, 2026-10-18. The indefinite Stardust goal remains active. Manuscripts remain read-only; no manuscript assertion supplies a Lean axiom.

## Exact source and version

The requested `ResearchSources/Incoming/EJP2605-044RA0(2).pdf` is absent. The preserved available source is `ResearchSources/ibm/EJP2605-044RA0.pdf`, 24 pages, 595476 bytes, SHA-256 `5A91914A535AD19BDDF219D7A9AB9F8B5F20A52DD4EC6ED7333AA80B403182BE`. Its title is *A Mollified Itô–Tanaka Formula for Iterated Brownian Motion and Its First-Chaos Dual Closure*. This hash matches the previous read-only source audit. No identity with the absent duplicate version is asserted. The PDF has placeholder journal metadata; publication or acceptance is not inferred.

The Incoming inventory remains a separate baseline: 43 files, 42 distinct hashes. It includes the Clark–Ocone manuscript and `ym_ns_dictionary.tex`; the IBM PDF above is outside Incoming. The previous freeze document's claim that the IBM PDF was included in those 43 files is corrected without changing the inventory or source.

Selective primary review: pages 3, 12, 18–19 and 22, including rendered pages 3, 12, 18 and 22. Fresh text and renders are under ignored `tmp/pdfs/stardust-ibm-1046/`. The older `ResearchSources/ResearchAudits/EJP2605_044RA0_SOURCE_AUDIT.md` is historical analysis, not instructions or a verified theorem. It remains unchanged.

## Actual manuscript obligations and existing Lean coverage

| Obligation | Existing verified foundation | Remaining distinction |
|---|---|---|
| Genuine independent continuous scenery and clock; actual IBM composition | `IBMConstructedSources`, `IBMSourceLaws`, `IBMContinuousComposition` | Already constructed; do not replace by an assumed process. |
| Mollified spatial chain rule, covariance cancellation and finite-horizon integrability | `IBMConstructedChainRule`, `IBMOffsetTranslation`, `IBMBoundaryVariance`, `IBMFiniteHorizonEvaluation` | Spatial chain rules and integrability do not alone prove the complete manuscript Itô–Tanaka decomposition. |
| Fixed-mollifier actual cubic correction and source-divergence recovery | `IBMClockCubicJointTimeL2`, `IBMClockCubicBochnerRecovery` | Actual joint/time L² and graph recovery are verified at fixed mollifier. No uniform shrinking-mollifier bound follows. |
| Spatial negative-Sobolev target and random derivative/boundary assembly | `IBMNegativeSobolevBounded`, `IBMNegativeSobolevRandom`, `IBMDeltaBoundary`, `IBMRandomBoundary`, `IBMDualDistribution` | These are actual Bessel-potential distributions and bounded Bochner maps. Identification of the manuscript's physical white-noise kernel with their inputs and convergence of those actual inputs remain obligations. |
| F1, pages 22–23: cross-sector summability as mollifier vanishes | Gaussian chaos, closed divergence, first-chaos obstruction and fixed-scale recovery | No global uniform weighted sector bound or convergent full correction has been proved here. Fixed-scale recovery cannot be advertised as F1. |
| F2, pages 18–19: random-functional L² limit of the boundary layer | Actual Brownian Tanaka residual, smooth curvature mass realization and continuous mass limit | The manuscript's compactly supported boundary residual must be connected to this actual clock mass with the correct normalization. An expectation limit is insufficient. |
| F3, pages 12 and 22: density of the maximal intrinsic IBM pullback core | Closed source derivative, fiber lift, actual unmollified source derivative below | The joint clock derivative and approximation by IBM-observable elements remain separate. Nonmembership of one observable does not imply nondensity. |

## Discovery1046: actual unmollified partial scenery derivative

`Foundation/IBMUnmollifiedSourceDerivative.lean` reuses the actual source derivative and the existing Bochner closed-operator lift. At each time t it proves:

* The existing class `randomSourceL2 t` belongs to the lifted closed scenery derivative domain. No derivative-domain hypothesis, mollification or new process is supplied.
* Its derivative is the actual Bochner-L² field obtained from the existing first-chaos gradient. Almost every clock sample has the constant scenery gradient given by the embedded Brownian Hilbert direction at `|Y_t|`.
* The gradient norm equals the observable's Bochner-L² norm, hence is finite. This concerns the partial scenery derivative, not a falsely bounded full derivative on all Gaussian observables.
* The actual mollified fields and their actual partial scenery gradients lie in that same closed graph and converge together in Bochner-L² product norm to the unmollified graph pair.
* Almost every section of the constructed continuous-path IBM coordinate agrees with the existing unmollified source class and lies in the scenery derivative domain.

Thus page 12's rationale that unmollified scenery-at-clock evaluation lies outside the scenery derivative domain does not survive the actual partial-source construction. The result does not supply the joint clock derivative, IBM-observable graph approximations, density of the intersection core, or an intrinsic adjoint. F3 itself remains open. The spectral-to-physical-white-noise kernel identification is also not silently assumed by this source-Hilbert proof.

## F2: precise next analytic route, not a completed Lean theorem

Here is a conditional reduction with an explicit topology and normalization. It is a research calculation; the required occupation-field inputs and actual manuscript coefficient identities have not yet been constructed in Lean.

Write v_e(r)=E_X[(X_r^e)^2], a_e(r)=Cov_X(X_r^e,∂_r X_r^e), and Q_j(v)=E[f^(j)(x+sqrt(v)N)] for a standard normal N. For the even mass-one Brownian scenery convolution, direct covariance differentiation suggests

v_e''(r)=2 rho_e(r), a_e(r)=v_e'(r)/2,

b_e(r)=(a_e(r)^2-1/4) Q_4(v_e(r)) + rho_e(r) Q_2(v_e(r)).

These must be proved from the existing actual covariance formula, including the boundary, rather than assumed from the bulk cancellation. On the layer 0≤r≤ce, |a_e|≤1/2 and v_e=O(e). For Schwartz f, Q_2(v_e)→f''(x) uniformly on the layer; the first term has integral O(e). Evenness gives integral_0^infinity rho_e=1/2. Consequently the candidate scalar layer mass is

m_e=integral_0^infinity b_e(r)dr → f''(x)/2.

To turn this into the requested random-functional result, suppose the actual reflected-clock occupation field L_t^r(|Y|), r>0, has the correct occupation identity and is mean-square continuous at the boundary with limit 2 L_t^0(Y). Let C bound integral|b_e| and let eta(e) bound the L²(clock) distance of L_t^r(|Y|) from 2 L_t^0(Y) on 0<r≤ce, with eta(e)→0. Bochner integration and the triangle inequality then give the explicit estimate

‖integral_0^t b_e(|Y_s|)ds - f''(x)L_t^0(Y)‖_L²
≤ C eta(e) + |2m_e-f''(x)| ‖L_t^0(Y)‖_L².

Both terms tend to zero under exactly these hypotheses. The correction's prefactor 1/2 then gives boundary limit (f''(x)/2)L_t^0(Y), whose expectation matches the manuscript's integrated source f''(x)sqrt(t/(2pi)). This is a random L² criterion, not an inference from equality of expectations. A full spatial local-time field is currently not identified in the IBM modules; constructing one merely for this purpose may be avoidable by applying the existing clock C² Itô/Tanaka approximation directly to the averaged mollified scenery function. Prefer that existing-process route if it closes the same estimate with less infrastructure.

No F1–F3 problem is declared solved at this checkpoint. Next priority is the actual F2 boundary coefficient/clock-mass identification, while preserving the distinction between partial scenery regularity and joint intrinsic regularity.

## Discovery1047: actual boundary curvature and its exact half-mass

`Foundation/IBMBoundaryCurvature.lean` closes the deterministic boundary-covariance identification needed in the preceding F2 route. It starts with the actual Gaussian-L² variance already represented by the two-sided Brownian covariance integral. For a continuous mass-one offset kernel it proves the exact scalar formula

V(x)=x+C+2 N(x),

where C is the existing offset covariance constant and N(x)=integral rho(-r) max(-(x+r),0)dr on the fixed offset window. The latter is identified with actual interval primitives when the moving boundary lies inside the window. Fundamental-theorem-of-calculus differentiation gives V'(x)=1-2 integral_a^(-x)rho(-r)dr and V''(x)=2rho(x) there. No local-time field, white-noise kernel identification or manuscript contraction rule is assumed.

For the original normalized smooth IBM bump, not an auxiliary smoothing family, this proves on |x|<R_n:

‖V_n(x)‖² + inner(U_n(x), W_n(x)) = rho_n(x),

inner(U_n(x), V_n(x)) = 1/2 - integral_(-R_n)^(-x)rho_n(-r)dr.

Here U_n is the actual mollified scenery and V_n,W_n its first and second spatial derivative fields; the scalar variance V(x) in the preceding paragraph is a different object. The identities are derived by comparing the actual variance derivatives with the existing Hilbert covariance derivative formulas. The cross-covariance at x=0 is proved zero using the concrete kernel's evenness and exact normalization.

The actual bracket's Lebesgue integral over [0,R_n] is proved exactly1/2. Endpoints are handled through nonatomic interval integral identities. The strict interior pointwise formula is not extended to endpoints by an unjustified substitution. In the positive bulk x>R_n the existing verified covariance cancellation remains applicable.

This verifies the bracket and normalization portion of the F2 calculation. It does not yet identify the general Schwartz-test residual b_n or prove its scalar mass limit, and it does not prove the random L² clock limit. A direct next process-level target is integral_0^t rho_n(|Y_s|)ds→L_t^0(Y) in L² for the already constructed clock and Tanaka mass. This is the boundary contribution for quadratic tests (outside the manuscript's Schwartz class); it would establish a genuine random limit and can serve the general bounded-coefficient argument. Prefer deriving it from the existing clock C² Itô and Tanaka approximations, with actual uniform terminal and predictable-field estimates, rather than assuming an unconstructed spatial local-time field.

## Discovery1048: genuine unweighted clock boundary limit in L²

The preceding process-level target is now verified, not a hypothesis. Write rho_n for the repository's original compact normalized IBM bump, Y for its constructed continuous Brownian clock and v_n(r)=E_X[(X_r^n)^2] for the actual scenery variance. `IBMVarianceClockGeometry` proves v_n is C² on the whole real line and v_n''=2rho_n everywhere. The strict-layer and exterior formulas are joined at the endpoints using actual continuity and Lebesgue almost-everywhere equality. It proves monotonicity of v_n', the global bound |v_n'|≤1, v_n'(0)=0, pointwise v_n'→sgn, pointwise v_n→|·|, and the common growth bound |v_n(r)|≤|r|+2. These facts concern the actual variance, not a surrogate absolute-value smoothing family.

`IBMBoundaryClockLimit` applies the existing Brownian C² Itô theorem to v_n. Its second-derivative bound is allowed to depend on n; no uniform C² bound is asserted. For each n and fixed finite horizon T the exact identity in the actual Gaussian L² space is

v_n(Y_T)-v_n(0) = integral_0^T v_n'(Y_s)dY_s + B_n(T),

where B_n(T)=integral_0^T rho_n(|Y_s|)ds. The stochastic term uses the original completed predictable Brownian integral. Actual Bochner representatives and Fubini identify B_n with this literal time integral along the constructed continuous clock; square integrability of that random functional is proved. Kernel evenness accounts for the reflection.

The actual predictable integrands converge in time/probability L² to sgn(Y); their stochastic integrals converge in Gaussian L² by continuity of the verified Itô map. The terminal values converge in Gaussian L² by the actual scenery approximation and a common square-integrable Brownian majorant. The constant v_n(0) tends to zero. Consequently

B_n(T) → |Y_T|-integral_0^T sgn(Y_s)dY_s = L_T^0(Y)

in Gaussian L² for every fixed T. The target is identified with the coordinate L² class of the previously constructed continuous Brownian mass path. This is a genuine random-functional limit, not a statement about its expectation or an assumed local-time occupation field. No uniform-in-T or almost-sure full-sequence convergence is claimed here.

Scope: this resolves the unweighted mollifier clock limit required for the proposed F2 reduction. The full general Schwartz residual b_n still requires identification of its actual Gaussian averaged coefficients and quantitative control of the coefficient error and bounded shrinking-layer term. Neither F2 in that full generality, cross-sector F1, nor intrinsic-density F3 is declared solved. Next use the new actual L² boundary-mass limit to control those coefficient errors; do not replace them by equality of expectations or introduce a new process/local-time foundation.
