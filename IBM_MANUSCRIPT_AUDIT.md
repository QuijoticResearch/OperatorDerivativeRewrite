# IBM manuscript audit and focused campaign

Opened after the final pseudoprocess freeze commit `a69daf025f2c9ef28e39124f2f4a5a301494666f`, 2026-10-18. The indefinite Stardust goal remains active. Manuscripts remain read-only; no manuscript assertion supplies a Lean axiom.

## Exact source and version

The requested `ResearchSources/Incoming/EJP2605-044RA0(2).pdf` is absent. The preserved available source is `ResearchSources/ibm/EJP2605-044RA0.pdf`, 24 pages, 595476 bytes, SHA-256 `5A91914A535AD19BDDF219D7A9AB9F8B5F20A52DD4EC6ED7333AA80B403182BE`. Its title is *A Mollified Itô–Tanaka Formula for Iterated Brownian Motion and Its First-Chaos Dual Closure*. This hash matches the previous read-only source audit. No identity with the absent duplicate version is asserted. The PDF has placeholder journal metadata; publication or acceptance is not inferred.

The Incoming inventory remains a separate baseline: 43 files, 42 distinct hashes. It includes the Clark–Ocone manuscript and `ym_ns_dictionary.tex`; the IBM PDF above is outside Incoming. The previous freeze document's claim that the IBM PDF was included in those 43 files is corrected without changing the inventory or source.

Selective primary review: pages 3, 12, 18–19 and 22, including rendered pages 3, 12, 18 and 22. Fresh text and renders are under ignored `tmp/pdfs/stardust-ibm-1046/`. The older `ResearchSources/ResearchAudits/EJP2605_044RA0_SOURCE_AUDIT.md` is historical analysis, not instructions or a verified theorem. It remains unchanged.

## Actual manuscript obligations and existing Lean coverage

| Obligation | Existing verified foundation | Remaining distinction |
|---|---|---|
| Genuine independent continuous scenery and clock; actual IBM composition | `IBMConstructedSources`, `IBMSourceLaws`, `IBMContinuousComposition` | Already constructed; do not replace by an assumed process. |
| Mollified spatial chain rule, covariance cancellation and finite-horizon integrability | `IBMConstructedChainRule`, `IBMOffsetTranslation`, `IBMBoundaryVariance`, `IBMFiniteHorizonEvaluation` | Spatial chain rules and integrability do not alone prove the complete manuscript Itô–Tanaka decomposition. |
| Fixed-mollifier actual cubic correction and source-divergence recovery | `IBMClockCubicJointTimeL2`, `IBMClockCubicBochnerRecovery` | Actual joint/time L² and graph recovery are verified at fixed mollifier. No uniform shrinking-mollifier bound follows. |
| Spatial negative-Sobolev target and random derivative/boundary assembly | `IBMNegativeSobolevBounded`, `IBMNegativeSobolevRandom`, `IBMDeltaBoundary`, `IBMRandomBoundary`, `IBMDualDistribution` | These are actual Bessel-potential distributions and bounded Bochner maps. Identification of the manuscript's physical white-noise kernel with their inputs and convergence of those actual inputs remain obligations. |
| F1, pages 22–23: cross-sector summability as mollifier vanishes | Gaussian chaos, closed divergence, first-chaos obstruction and fixed-scale recovery | No global uniform weighted sector bound or convergent full correction has been proved here. Fixed-scale recovery cannot be advertised as F1. |
| F2, pages 18–19: random-functional L² limit of the boundary layer | Actual Brownian Tanaka residual, smooth curvature mass realization and continuous mass limit | The manuscript's compactly supported boundary residual must be connected to this actual clock mass with the correct normalization. An expectation limit is insufficient. |
| F3, pages 12 and 22: density of the maximal intrinsic IBM pullback core | Closed source derivative, fiber lift, actual unmollified source derivative below | The joint clock derivative and approximation by IBM-observable elements remain separate. Nonmembership of one observable does not imply nondensity. |

## Discovery1046: actual unmollified partial scenery derivative

`Foundation/IBMUnmollifiedSourceDerivative.lean` reuses the actual source derivative and the existing Bochner closed-operator lift. At each time t it proves:

* The existing class `randomSourceL2 t` belongs to the lifted closed scenery derivative domain. No derivative-domain hypothesis, mollification or new process is supplied.
* Its derivative is the actual Bochner-L² field obtained from the existing first-chaos gradient. Almost every clock sample has the constant scenery gradient given by the embedded Brownian Hilbert direction at `|Y_t|`.
* The gradient norm equals the observable's Bochner-L² norm, hence is finite. This concerns the partial scenery derivative, not a falsely bounded full derivative on all Gaussian observables.
* The actual mollified fields and their actual partial scenery gradients lie in that same closed graph and converge together in Bochner-L² product norm to the unmollified graph pair.
* Almost every section of the constructed continuous-path IBM coordinate agrees with the existing unmollified source class and lies in the scenery derivative domain.

Thus page 12's rationale that unmollified scenery-at-clock evaluation lies outside the scenery derivative domain does not survive the actual partial-source construction. The result does not supply the joint clock derivative, IBM-observable graph approximations, density of the intersection core, or an intrinsic adjoint. F3 itself remains open. The spectral-to-physical-white-noise kernel identification is also not silently assumed by this source-Hilbert proof.

## F2: precise next analytic route, not a completed Lean theorem

Here is a conditional reduction with an explicit topology and normalization. It is a research calculation; the required occupation-field inputs and actual manuscript coefficient identities have not yet been constructed in Lean.

Write v_e(r)=E_X[(X_r^e)^2], a_e(r)=Cov_X(X_r^e,∂_r X_r^e), and Q_j(v)=E[f^(j)(x+sqrt(v)N)] for a standard normal N. For the even mass-one Brownian scenery convolution, direct covariance differentiation suggests

v_e''(r)=2 rho_e(r), a_e(r)=v_e'(r)/2,

b_e(r)=(a_e(r)^2-1/4) Q_4(v_e(r)) + rho_e(r) Q_2(v_e(r)).

These must be proved from the existing actual covariance formula, including the boundary, rather than assumed from the bulk cancellation. On the layer 0≤r≤ce, |a_e|≤1/2 and v_e=O(e). For Schwartz f, Q_2(v_e)→f''(x) uniformly on the layer; the first term has integral O(e). Evenness gives integral_0^infinity rho_e=1/2. Consequently the candidate scalar layer mass is

m_e=integral_0^infinity b_e(r)dr → f''(x)/2.

To turn this into the requested random-functional result, suppose the actual reflected-clock occupation field L_t^r(|Y|), r>0, has the correct occupation identity and is mean-square continuous at the boundary with limit 2 L_t^0(Y). Let C bound integral|b_e| and let eta(e) bound the L²(clock) distance of L_t^r(|Y|) from 2 L_t^0(Y) on 0<r≤ce, with eta(e)→0. Bochner integration and the triangle inequality then give the explicit estimate

‖integral_0^t b_e(|Y_s|)ds - f''(x)L_t^0(Y)‖_L²
≤ C eta(e) + |2m_e-f''(x)| ‖L_t^0(Y)‖_L².

Both terms tend to zero under exactly these hypotheses. The correction's prefactor 1/2 then gives boundary limit (f''(x)/2)L_t^0(Y), whose expectation matches the manuscript's integrated source f''(x)sqrt(t/(2pi)). This is a random L² criterion, not an inference from equality of expectations. A full spatial local-time field is currently not identified in the IBM modules; constructing one merely for this purpose may be avoidable by applying the existing clock C² Itô/Tanaka approximation directly to the averaged mollified scenery function. Prefer that existing-process route if it closes the same estimate with less infrastructure.

No F1–F3 problem is declared solved at this checkpoint. Next priority is the actual F2 boundary coefficient/clock-mass identification, while preserving the distinction between partial scenery regularity and joint intrinsic regularity.
