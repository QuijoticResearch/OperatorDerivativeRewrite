# PROJECT STARDUST — OVERNIGHT DISCOVERIES

## Durable campaign state

Started 2026-10-14 from e7dac26ea306c89e3df9ddba015b54554a7caf2b in C:\OperatorDerivativeRewrite. No prior PROJECT_STARDUST_REPORT.md existed. Tracked tree was clean. Preserve the twelve unrelated untracked documents and ResearchSources. Lean 4.34.1 / pinned Mathlib unchanged. No agents, automation, manuscript writes, dependency upgrades, destructive cleanup or push.

This report is durable research memory. Entries marked verified have completed the full build, public type inspection and transitive axiom audit. Ongoing conjectures are separate. No execution after the active session is promised.

## Discovery 1 — Actual Poisson adjunction reconstructs the all-order Charlier ladder

Verified: Foundation/PoissonCharlierLadder.lean constructs monic polynomials recursively by P0=1 and P(n+1)(x)=x Pn(x-1)-lambda Pn(x). Their genuine scalar Poisson-L2 and rate-weighted field-L2 representatives satisfy D P(n+1)=(n+1)Pn and delta Pn=P(n+1), in the exact maximal operator graphs. Every degree has actual number-operator eigenvalue n. These facts follow from the previously verified closed mutual adjoints, with full polynomial moment domains; no formal operator is substituted for a closed operator.

The same adjoint duality proves orthogonality and ||Pn||²=n! lambda^n. The field norm includes its real rate factor: inner_field(Pn,Pm)=lambda inner_scalar(Pn,Pm). This normalization is essential to the ladder and energy calculation.

Mathematical significance: the Gaussian Wick and Poisson Charlier systems are both reconstructed by source raising/lowering adjunction, despite distinct local chain rules. This is known Charlier mathematics, now connected to the repository's actual unbounded Poisson operators; no new mathematical novelty claim. Reference for standard nomenclature/recurrences: https://dlmf.nist.gov/18.22.

Verification: full Lake build 4310 jobs (.lake/stardust-01-build.log), all 21 public declarations type-checked and 6255 safe Foundation declarations transitively audited (.lake/stardust-01-audit.lean and .log). Only propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound. No placeholders/custom axioms/unsafe additions. The independently verified milestone commit is the commit containing this entry.

Reflection: equal ladder energy does not imply equal multiplication algebra or ordinary chain rules. Poisson polynomial completeness and a unitary transfer to Gaussian chaos are not yet proved. A future focused campaign could establish polynomial density, the Poisson number spectral decomposition and a precise Hilbert transfer while exhibiting multiplication defects.
